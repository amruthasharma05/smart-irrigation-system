# Smart-irrigation-system
Smart Irrigation System focuses on Irrigation through IoT based Circuit which automates water supply using sensors using sensors and a lpc2148
## About the project
This project involves Smart Irrigation Using IOT and system development though C Programming.The Core idea of this project is to supply water to the soil based on the moisture contained in the soil and also displaying the moisture contained in the soil.By using sensors,the system avoids unnecessary water wastage and helps in better irrigation management.

##Components Used
LPC2148 Microcontroller
Soil Moisture Sensor
Relay Module
Water Pump
Power Supply

##Software Used
Embedded C
Keil µVision
Flash Magic

## Working of the System
The soil moisture sensor is placed in the soil to measure the moisture level.If the soil is dry, the sensor sends a signal to the microcontroller and the relay is activated. This turns ON the water pump and irrigation starts.Once the soil reaches sufficient moisture, the pump is switched OFF automatically.


## Applications
Agricultural fields
Garden irrigation
Small-scale farming

## Conclusion
This project helps in reducing water wastage and minimizes manual effort in irrigation. It is simple, cost-effective, and suitable for basic smart farming applications.
